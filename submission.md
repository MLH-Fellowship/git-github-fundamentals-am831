## What I Learned

- This course helped me review github fundamentals, all of which I have prior experience with
- A repository is the project's folder which contains all of its files and revision history
- Cloning is when I make a copy of a repository on my local machine. This is where I make contributions to other projects. When I make a change, I commit it to my local repo. When I'm ready for the project maintainer to review my work, I open a pull request to get my local repo merged into the upstream repo
- I use commit and push to sync the changes I made on my local repo with the remote repo hosted on github. This allows others to see my work on my remote repo
- Branches are copies of the main repo. This allows me to switch between different versions of my repo. I can make a new branch that is a copy of any other branch, and I can merge branches to combine them. I would normally make a new branch off of the main branch for every different feature, issue, bug, etc that I'm working on. This allows me to isolate different parts of my work.
- Forks are used to make copies of other repos, so I can make changes without affecting the original repo. I fork a repo when I want to contribute to someone else's project, then I clone it to my local machine. I would not normally make a fork of a repo I already own.
- Pull requests are used to contribute to a project. When I fork someone else's repo, I can open a pull request from a specific branch on my fork. This is how I get feedback for the changes I made on the branch, and if approved, the project maintainer can merge my branch into the original repo.
- Issues are used to keep track of work that needs to be done on a repo. I can open an issue if I catch a bug or think of a feature I would like to add. I can also browse existing issues and pick one to work on.
- My user profile contains all of my repos and itneractions on github. It is like a portfolio for my work.
- Markdown is used for the description section in repos, issues, pull requests, and user profiles. It allows me to stylize my descriptions, organize information, insert images, and more.
- The github community allows users to interact with each other. I can follow other users, companies and organizations. I can star repos to save them on my profile. I can use github explore to discover new repos, users, and events.
